The R Model builds on the test and train files from the Python data pipeline.
A Random Forest model is trained with 500 trees and a depth of 3.

Ideally, a cross valdiation should be done, however the initial model seems to work with good accuracy.

Following is the code.

```{r}
library(randomForest)
## Build a Random Forrest Model
setwd("C:/Users/gnagaraj/Downloads")

#Prepare the Test and Train Datasets
train_df=read.csv("Train_split.csv",colClasses = c("Discretized_Read_Rate"="factor"))
test_df=read.csv("Test_split.csv",colClasses = c("Discretized_Read_Rate"="factor"))

#Drop unwanted columns
train_df <- subset(train_df,select = -c(X,id,read_rate))
test_df <- subset(test_df,select = -c(X,id,read_rate))

#Train a Random Forrest Model with 500 trees and depth of 3
rf <- randomForest(Discretized_Read_Rate ~ .,data = train_df)

#Predict the test data
predictions<-predict(rf,subset(test_df,select = -c(Discretized_Read_Rate)))

#Calculate the Confusion Matrix
cm<-table(as.numeric(unlist(test_df['Discretized_Read_Rate'])),as.numeric(predictions))
print(cm)

#Print the Accuracy
print(c("Accuracy",sum(diag(cm)/sum(cm))))
```
